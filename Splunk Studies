1. List top 5 client that got most error in purchasing process using SPL.
index=fundamentals sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie action=purchase file="error.do"

2. List clientips that got error in purchasing process. Change below mentioned field

(clientip = CustomerIP, count= Number_FailedOrder)
index=fundamentals sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie action=purchase file="error.do"
| rename clientip as CustomerIP
| stats count as Number_FailedOrder by CustomerIP 
| where Number_FailedOrder >20

3. Show files that got more than 35MB internet traffic during December 2021
index=fundamentals sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie date_year=2021 date_month=december
| stats sum(bytes) as Total by file
| eval Total_MB=Total/(1024*1024)
| where Total_MB>35

4. a)Show clientIPs and their number of processes for users who connected from

index=fundamentals sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie 
| iplocation clientip 
| stats count by Country,clientip
| where Country="Germany"

index=fundamentals sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
